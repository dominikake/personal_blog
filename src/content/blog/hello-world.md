# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post on this new personal site.

I'm excited to start writing about my thoughts, experiences, and projects here. This blog is built with Next.js and styled with the beautiful Rosé Pine color scheme.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a simple, clean space to share my ideas and document my journey as a developer. This site will serve as a home for:

- Technical thoughts and tutorials
- Project updates
- Personal reflections

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
